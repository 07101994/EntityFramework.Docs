Fixing Reflection Errors
------------------------

Applications using EF on Universal Windows Platform may encounter errors due to current limitations in .NET Native.
These errors usually appear as ``MissingRuntimeArtifactException`` or ``MissingMetadataException``, which are casued by incomplete reflection support in .NET Native. In most cases,
these errors can be resolved by adding the proper `Runtime Directive <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn600639(v=vs.110).aspx>`_.
