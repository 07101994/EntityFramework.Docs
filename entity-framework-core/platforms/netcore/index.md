# Getting Started on .NET Core (Windows, OSX, Linux, etc.)

> [!WARNING]
> This documentation is for EF Core. For EF6.x and earlier release see [http://msdn.com/data/ef](http://msdn.com/data/ef).

These 101 tutorials require no previous knowledge of Entity Framework (EF) or Visual Studio. They will take you step-by-step through creating a simple application that queries and saves data from a database.

EF can be used on all platforms (Windows, OSX, Linux, etc.) that support .NET Core.
