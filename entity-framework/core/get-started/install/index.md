# Installing Entity Framework Core

## Prerequisites

* EF Core is a [.NET Standard 2.0](/dotnet/standard/net-standard) library. This means that EF Core requires a .NET implementation that supports .NET Standard 2.0 to run. It can also be referenced by other .NET Standard 2.0 libraries. 

* For example, you can use EF Core to develop apps that target .NET Core. This requires the [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) and optinially a development environment, like Visual Studio, Visual Studio for Mac, or Visual Studio Code. For more information, check [Getting Started with .NET Core](/dotnet/core/get-started).

* You can use EF Core to develop applications that target .NET Framework 4.6.1 or later on Windows, using Visual Studio. The latest version of Visual Studio is recommended. If you want to use an older version, like Visual Studio 2015, make sure you [upgrade the NuGet client to version 3.6.0](https://www.nuget.org/downloads) to work with .NET Standard 2.0 libraries.

* EF Core can be used with other .NET implementations like Xamarin and .NET Native, but in practice those have runtime limitations that may affect how well they work with EF Core and your app. For more information, see [.NET implementations supported by EF Core](xref:core/platforms/index).

* Finally, different database providers have different requirements regarding database engine versions, .NET implementations, and operating systems. Make sure an [EF Core database provider](xref:core/providers/index) is available that supports the right envinroment  for your application.

## Get the Entity Framework Core runtime

To add EF Core to an application, install the NuGet package for the database provider you want to use.

You won't need to install the in-memory and SQL Server providers if you are building an ASP.NET Core application. Those providers, as well as the EF Core runtime, are included in current versions of ASP.NET Core.  

To install or update NuGet packages, you can use the .NET Core CLI, the Visual Studio Package Manager Dialog, or the Visual Studio Package Manager Console.

### .NET Core CLI

* The following .NET Core CLI command installs or updates the SQL Server provider:

  ``` Console
  dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
  ```

* You can indicate a specific version in the `dotnet add package` command, using the `-v` modifier. For example, to install EF Core 2.2.0 packages, append `-v 2.2.0` to the command.

For more information, see [.NET command-line interface (CLI) tools](/dotnet/core/tools/).

### Visual Studio NuGet Package Manager Dialog

* From the menu, select **Project > Manage NuGet Packages**

* Click on the **Browse** or the **Updates** tab

* To install or update the SQL Server provider, select the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer` package, and confirm.

For more information, see [NuGet Package Manager Dialog](/nuget/tools/package-manager-ui).

### Visual Studio NuGet Package Manager Console

* From the menu, select **Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console**

* To install the SQL Server provider, run the following command in the Package Manager Console:

  ``` PowerShell  
  Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
  ```
* To update the provider, use the `Update-Package` command.

* To specify a specific version, use the `-Version` modifier. For example, to install EF Core 2.2.0 packages, append `-Version 2.2.0` to the commands

For more information, see [Package Manager Console](/nuget/tools/package-manager-console).

## Get the Entity Framework Core tools

You can install tools to carry out EF Core-related tasks in your project, like creating and applying database migrations, or creating an EF Core model based on an existing database.

Two sets of tools are available:

* The .NET Core [command-line interface (CLI) tools](xref:core/miscellaneous/cli/dotnet) can be used on Windows, Linux, or macOS. These commands begin with `dotnet ef`. 

* The [Package Manager Console (PMC) tools](xref:core/miscellaneous/cli/powershell) run in Visual Studio on Windows. These commands start with a verb, for example `Add-Migration`, `Update-Database`.

Although you can use the `dotnet ef` commands from the Package Manager Console, it's more convenient to use the Package Manager Console tools when you're using Visual Studio:

* They automatically work with the current project selected in the PMC in Visual Studio, without requiring manually switching directories.  

* They automatically open files generated by the commands in Visual Studio after the command is completed.

### Get the CLI tools

.NET Core CLI tools require the .NET Core SDK, mentioned earlier in [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).

The `dotnet ef` commands are included in current versions of the .NET Core SDK, but to enable the commands you have to install the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design` package:

 ``` Console	
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design	
```	

For ASP.NET Core apps, this package is included automatically.

> [!IMPORTANT]  	
> Always use the version of the tools package that matches the major version of the runtime packages.

### Get the Package Manager Console tools

To get the Package Manager Console tools for EF Core, install the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools` package:

 ``` Console	
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools
```	

For ASP.NET Core apps, this package is included automatically.

## Upgrading to the latest EF Core

* If you need to update an application that is using a third-party database provider, always check for an update of the provider that is compatible with the version of EF Core you want to use. For example, database providers for previous versions are not compatible with version 2.0 of the EF Core runtime.  

* Since EF Core is included in current versions of ASP.NET Core, to upgrade to a newer version of EF Core, upgrade the version of ASP.NET Core.

* If you're upgrading an existing application to the latest version of EF Core, some references to older EF Core packages may need to be removed manually:

  * Database provider design-time packages such as `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer.Design` are no longer required or supported from EF Core 2.0 and later, but aren't automatically removed when upgrading the other packages.

  * The .NET CLI tools are included in the .NET SDK since version 2.1, so the reference to that package can be removed from the project file:

    ```
    <DotNetCliToolReference Include="Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools.DotNet" Version="2.0.0" />
    ```

* Applications that target .NET Framework may need changes to work with .NET Standard 2.0 libraries:

  * Edit the project file and make sure the following entry appears in the initial property group:

    ``` xml
    <AutoGenerateBindingRedirects>true</AutoGenerateBindingRedirects>
    ```

  * For test projects, also make sure the following entry is present:

    ``` xml
    <GenerateBindingRedirectsOutputType>true</GenerateBindingRedirectsOutputType>
    ```
