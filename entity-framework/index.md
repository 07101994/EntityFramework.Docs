# Entity Framework

Entity Framework is an object-relational mapper (O/RM) that enables .NET developers to work with a database using .NET objects. It eliminates the need for most of the data-access code that developers usually need to write.

## Entity Framework 6.x

Entity Framework 6.x (EF6.x) is a tried and tested data access technology with many years of features and stabilization. It first released in 2008, as part of .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 and Visual Studio 2008 SP1. Starting with the EF4.1 release it has shipped as the [EntityFramework NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/EntityFramework/) - currently the most popular package on NuGet.org.

## Entity Framework Core

Entity Framework Core (EF Core) is a lightweight, extensible, and cross-platform version of Entity Framework. EF Core introduces many improvements and new features when compared with EF6.x. At the same time, EF Core is a new code base and very much a v1 product.
